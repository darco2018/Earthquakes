# Earthquakes
An applet I worked on while doing a **`Coursera`**'s Java course **`Object Oriented Programming in Java`**  in 2015. 
 (about the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java#)
(certificate of completion: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/SLS3H4RK8N5U)

The applet uses **Unfoldingmaps** library, **Processing** library plus a feed from **http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_week.atom**. 

The skeleten of the app was written by Coursera. I had to implement the city, landquake and oceanquake markers to visualise different aspects of earthquake data. 

Part of the assignement was to come up with an extension of my own. I added a method, which showed the earthquake which was the closest to a clicked city marker. ( EarthquakeCityMap.quakeNearCustomLocation() )

I know - the code is untidy. :-)
